## Course outline

The course is intended for analysts with little to no prior experience of Shiny and covers the following:

-   Introduction to Shiny and setting out your code

-   Your first application

-   Build a real application

-   Simplifying reactivity with reactive expressions

-   Optional:

    -   NSE in Shiny applications

    -   Bookmarks

-   Dynamic UI

-   Writing nice error messages for your Shiny applications

-   Downloading files/ Rmarkdown

-   Custom layout functions

-   {shinydashboard}

-   Interacting with a Shiny plot


## Prerequisites

The material is pitched at analysts with at least beginner level of R. The more familiar you are with R, the better able you will be to complete the exercises but if you get stuck you can browse the answers so you shouldn't get completely left behind. Those who are very competent at R or have a bit of experience with Shiny are likely to get through the material with time to spare and there is extra material for those who might otherwise finish a bit early.

## Preparation

For the course you can either use the NHS-R Community cloud which has everything set up or you can download all the course material to your own laptop. Instructions for the NHS-R Community introduction to R and R Studio are same up to the point of installing packages.

You can also type the following code into the Console:

``` r
# install.packages("usethis")
usethis::use_course("nhs-r-community/shiny-training")
```
which downloads the zip from this page, creates a project in a default location and unzips the documents ready to use. You will be asked to confirm whether or not to delete the zip file.

Note that the {usethis} package must be downloaded first to run and has been commented out in this example code.

Other packages that need to be installed for this course are:

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("leaflet")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("shinydashboard")
install.packages("DiagrammeR")
install.packages("DT")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("knitr")
```
